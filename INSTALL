This is an excerpt from our maintenance manual. For more details you
should refer to it.

Installation
============

Clone from the git repository

  git clone git@bitbucket.org:carolsescu/aberdeengo.git

Change to the AberdeenGo directory

  cd aberdeengo

Install all the dependencies. This is accomplished using the Python
Pip package manager.

  sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Python will automatically byte-compile files as it runs them, so no
compilation step is necessary.

Test Run
========

Having installed the software, the website can then be run locally
with Django's development server.

  python manage.py runserver

The web page can be accessed locally from http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

The software comes with a test SQLite3 database, so you can
immediately try it out.
